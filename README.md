# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple web game of Tic Tac Toe

Easy, medium and impossible difficulties available, hard to be done. (Hard is not minimax, as playing a forced draw all the time is boring...)

Code needs a lot of polishing, and the background needs a bit of a resize.

This branch is for refactoring code into a (far) less globally coded JS.
